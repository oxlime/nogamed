## NoGamed

Bot to help users play the MatchboxDao No-Game on Starknet

Mines and factories are upgraded in order of the strat.json file originally set to follow the Ogame strategy guide https://ogame.fandom.com/wiki/Quick_Start_Guide

Further plans to help players automate tasks in game including raiding, allowing players to select different mode and strategy

I chose to use Go for ease of control over threading for various purposes including different modes in future

This is a prototype and under experimental developement

First mode available will be mining automation
